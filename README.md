# Tegrity
A mass file integrity checker. (that doesn't work)

### What does it do?
Tegrity checks for file integrity. This means that it will check files from a list if they have changed.
This can be usefull for resolving merge conflicts or just keeping track of your files if you are on a shared computer.
