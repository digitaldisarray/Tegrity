# Tegrity
A mass file integrity checker. (that doesn't work)

# Changelog (kinda)
I have stopped working on the gui part of it because I want to get a working cli based version before I distract myself.

### What does it do?
Tegrity checks for file integrity. This means that it will check files from a list if they have changed.
This can be usefull for resolving merge conflicts or just keeping track of your files if you are on a shared computer.
